An adult immersion program gave Nicole Bilodeau proficiency in Kanien’kéha, known in English as Mohawk, in her late 20s, but she advocates for an earlier start. Young adults need to learn the language and go on to speak it exclusively to their children, she says. Otherwise, the community will lose all first-language fluency from its approximately 1,000 speakers within a generation. “Speaking the language makes me feel like I’m doing something positive to support my community.”

The Algonquin language has always been part of Mary Stella Decontie’s life. She grew up speaking it with her parents as part of the Kitigan Zibi First Nation. Algonquin is part of the Algonquian language family, which also includes Cree and Innu, and was once one of the most widespread Indigenous language groups. While Mary is helping teach others as an Algonquin Language Keeper at the Wabano Centre, more needs to be done to help preserve the language. “The recording of the language needs to be captured before the elders pass to the spirit world,” she says.
